Furthermore, patients may not always have access to the required data, leading to data gaps that affect the overall reliability of the AI system. Ensuring the completeness and accuracy of health data is crucial for AI models to make reliable predictions and offer meaningful health recommendations.

3.	Lack of Personalized Recommendations

Many existing AI health models provide generic advice based on broad health trends or population-wide data. These recommendations often fail to account for individual variations, such as age, medical history, lifestyle choices, and genetic predisposition. Personalized health advice, tailored specifically to the user’s unique profile, is essential for improving health outcomes and user engagement.

11
 
Personalized recommendations can be enhanced by integrating multiple data sources, such as wearable device data, electronic health records, and environmental factors, to create a more accurate health profile.

4.	Integration Challenges

One of the primary challenges in existing AI-based health assistants is the lack of integration across multiple data sources. Many health models operate in isolation, relying on a single source of data (e.g., wearable data, electronic records, or medical history), which limits the depth and accuracy of health predictions. Effective integration of these diverse data streams is necessary to provide a holistic view of the individual’s health and improve prediction accuracy. Addressing these integration challenges is crucial for the development of a more comprehensive and effective AI-powered health assistant system.
